Building OpenWrt for the Gateworks Laguna Platform
-----------------------------------------------------------

In order to build OpenWRT for the Gateworks Laguna you will need the patches
in this directory and the Backfire release of the OpenWrt development tree.
Once the Openwrt tree has been downloaded, the patches will need to be
applied to it. A step-by-step instruction along with command is given below.
Before proceeding please read prerequisites section on the OpenWrt howto 
build wiki page located here:
http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build
Please ensure your development box has all of the listed packages installed
before proceeding.


1. Download OpenWrt Backfire Release to development directory

# cd /usr/src
# svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/backfire@22162


2. Download Gateworks OpenWrt Patches

# cd /usr/src
# svn co http://svn.gateworks.com/bsp/laguna/trunk/openwrt_patches


3. Apply Gateworks Patches to OpenWrt Tree

# /usr/src/backfire/scripts/patch-kernel.sh /usr/src/backfire \
/usr/src/openwrt_patches/patches/base

4. Download OpenWrt Packages

# cd /usr/src/backfire
# make package/symlinks


5. Add Packages (or not)
-- NOTE --
It is "strongly" suggested that no changes are made the first time
you build this directory in order to have the same results as Gateworks.
When finished editing exit and SAVE

# make menuconfig


6. Make

# make V=99


7. Now go get coffee while the kernel and filesystem is downloaded and built
-- NOTE --
Your development box will need access to the internet in order to download the
files for the development tree.


8. Copy the binaries to a tftp server

#mkdir /tftpboot/laguna
# cp /usr/src/backfire/bin/cns3xxx/openwrt-cns3xxx-uImage /tftpboot/laguna/uImage
# cp /usr/src/backfire/bin/cns3xxx/openwrt-cns3xxx-squashfs.img /tftpboot/laguna/rootfs


9. Connect your Laguna Platform to your network, set ipaddress and serverip in uboot

<boot the board and hit a key to enter into u-boot prompt>
# sete ipaddr <localip>
# sete serverip <serverip>

i.e. Set localip to 192.168.1.211 and serverip to 192.168.1.14

# sete ipaddr 192.168.1.211
# sete serverip 192.168.1.14


10. Erase what is on the board currently (once executed the linux fs and kernel will be lost)

# erase 0x10060000 0x10ffffff


11. Copy Linux Kernel to the Board

# tftpboot 0x800000 laguna/uImage
# cp.b 0x800000 0x10060000 $(filesize)


12. Copy rootfs to the Board

# tftpboot 0x800000 laguna/rootfs
# cp.b 0x800000 0x10260000 $(filesize)


13. Reboot the board

# reset


If no changes have been made to the default environment variables, you board
will boot to a linux prompt on your newly built kernel/filesystem. If you
wish, return to step 5 to add/remove packages that you wish to have on your
product.

If there are any question/concerns or you would like to contribute to the
development of the Laguna Platform a mailing list has been setup and you can
